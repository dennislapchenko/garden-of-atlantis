## Meanings
We as humans heavily operate within the realm of meanings, which are the interpretations we assign to our experiences. These meanings shape our perceptions, emotions, and behaviors, influencing how we navigate the world and interact with others. However when all chosen meanings are left aside, we can, perhaps, touch some Absolute Truths.

## Context
Initially inspired by World of Warcraft professions and OldSchool Runescape skills. Those games 'hacked' the neurvous system.. locking life's most precious emotional moments in those games. Even continuous therapy doesnt help much, life's events, albeit very varied, do not bring much joy. So perhaps real world has to be influenced a bit by the same forces that shaped the psyche, perhaps it will help in shaping the meanings.

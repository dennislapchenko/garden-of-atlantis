# Garden of Wiki

This is my [digital garden](<(https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)>) where I am nurturing my ideas, thoughts, concepts, ignorances, cheatsheets and everything in-between.
No page is a finished post and is always work in progress. Just like us :)

## Contents

- [Nutrition](./nutrition)
  - [Water](./nutrition/water.md)
- [Travelling](./travelling)
  - [Bali](./travelling/bali.md)
- [Technology](./technology)
  - Artificial Intelligence
    - [LLM (GPT)](./technology/ai/llm.md)

## [Tags](tags)

Tags represent at which stage each particular post is.
Initial drafts are just a `Seed`, more content shape and structure make them a `Sprout` and up it goes.
Final stage, `Harvested` is when the post is considered fully completed, there is nothing else to tend to. (a very unlikely stage..)

Additionally some tags mark content like `Books`, `Podcasts` or `Products`

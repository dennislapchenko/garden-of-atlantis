# Garden of Wiki
This is my [digital garden]((https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)) where I am nurturing my ideas, thoughts, concepts, ignorances, cheatsheets and everything in-between.
No page is a finished post and is always work in progress. Just like us :)


### Inspiration

### Tags
Tags represent at which stage each particular post is.
Initial drafts are just a `Seed`, more content shape and structure make them a `Sprout` and up it goes.
Final stage, `Harvested` is when the post is considered fully completed, there is nothing else to tend to. (a very unlikely stage..)

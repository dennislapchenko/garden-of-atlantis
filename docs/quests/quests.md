# Quests

Quests are the tasks that we set ourselves to accomplish, often with a goal in mind. Quests can be personal, professional, or spiritual in nature. They can be simple or complex, one dimensional and multi-dimensional, utilizing one or many skills, with short or long timelines and they can be completed or abandoned. Quests are a fundamental part of human existence, as they utilize a sense of purpose, meaning, and direction in our lives.

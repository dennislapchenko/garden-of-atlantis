# Bali

Beautiful nature on this island. Delicious fruit. Ever-warm and wavey ocean.
Some of the waterfalls possess great power, after some ceremonies was shaking with energy vibrantly.

## Issues with Bali

- In Indonesia it's extremely difficult for foreigners to easily get a job. You need a full-fledged expensive work/living visa (KITAS).
  - This is creating a very uneasy mechanic, especially on Bali, where around 80% of income is from tourism.
  - Locals are the ones who are (almost) exclusively allowed to work in all tourist places.
  - HOWEVER all the places are (almost) exlusively owned by foreigners.. so all the tourist income is really gained by the tourist ventures... and locals are paid peanuts for their hard (often 7 days a week) work.
  - It is a very deep and not-an-easy-to-explain-for-a-layman topic, but after spending some time on Bali, it is evident that there is this implicit envy or even hate by the locals who see all these luxuriously relaxing foreigners. 
  - This is just a first pass of these thoughts. But this mechanic makes it very less desirable to live on Bali. The government has forced the locals to be the only ones doing these low pay jobs, so they 'serve' the rich foreigners, but its only human nature to start envying and eventually subtly hating these people (despite trying their best to smile and be friendly).
  - Maybe these impressions aren't accurate, we live in different worlds after all (meaning some thing I, as a westerner, will never be able to understand). But this is the impresson I am getting after nearly 8 months on the island.

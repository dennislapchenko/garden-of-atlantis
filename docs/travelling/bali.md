# Bali

Beautiful nature on this island. Delicious fruit. Ever-warm and wavey ocean.
Some of the waterfalls possess great power, after some ceremonies was shaking with energy vibrantly.

### Uluwatu
Out of all places Uluwatu feels the most relaxed and that summerhouse vibe,
and does have some fancy places if one needs.
Ocean is really close and the beaches are really 

Pros:
- Very green everywhere. A lot of construction like everywhere else, but for now quite green, especially Pecatu area.
- Not many pompous tourists around, as mosty its a surfer destination
- Ocean is very close, with nice caves and bright sand beaches. Pantai (beach) Suluban is a cave with unique swimming experience, semi diving with goggles is very fun. However, during low tides the ocean goes too far back. Made a mistake once trying to get to water barefeet, walking on coral... dangerous mistake, feet full of circular punctures. Coral spores in wounds can be quite dangerous.
- Overall homey feel as Pecatu area seems somewhat secluded from everything
- In Pecatu - no traffic issues

Cons:
- Not as many health/organic shops to choose from. In fact impossible to find organic fruits and vegetables
- Is at the very end of the archipelago, getting to other islands destinations is painful

### Canggu

Pros:
- Many health/organic stores, with fruits and vegetables
- Options for authentic, Russian banya influenced, sauna experiences
- Closer to Ubud and other destinations
- Pererenan the next village, is very quiet in places, almost like Uluwatu

Cons:
- Full of pompous tourists
- Silly traffic


### Ubud

Pros:
- Numerous waterfalls are close. Some offer ceremonial experiences, which are very energetically potent
- More temples per square km than anywhere else


### Kuta/Denpasar

## Issues with Bali

- In Indonesia it's extremely difficult for foreigners to easily get a job. You need a full-fledged expensive work/living visa (KITAS).
  - This is creating a very uneasy mechanic, especially on Bali, where around 80% of income is from tourism.
  - Locals are the ones who are (almost) exclusively allowed to work in all tourist places.
  - HOWEVER all the places are (almost) exlusively owned by foreigners.. so all the tourist income is really gained by the tourist ventures... and locals are paid peanuts for their hard (often 7 days a week) work.
  - It is a very deep and not-an-easy-to-explain-for-a-layman topic, but after spending some time on Bali, it is evident that there is this implicit envy or even hate by the locals who see all these luxuriously relaxing foreigners. 
  - This is just a first pass of these thoughts. But this mechanic makes it very less desirable to live on Bali. The government has forced the locals to be the only ones doing these low pay jobs, so they 'serve' the rich foreigners, but its only human nature to start envying and eventually subtly hating these people (despite trying their best to smile and be friendly).
  - Maybe these impressions aren't accurate, we live in different worlds after all (meaning some thing I, as a westerner, will never be able to understand). But this is the impresson I am getting after nearly 8 months on the island.

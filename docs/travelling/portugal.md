# Portugal

## Madeira

Honestly possibly the best place to live in Europe! (however I haven't seen much of course xD)

- Easy access to ocean
- Crazy mountains with evergreen misty forests
- Countless beautiful levadas (hiking trails)
- Warm all year round. Winters are +-15C during day and it feels like +30 on the sun
- Food grows all year round

## Porto

A city very warm and full of vibrancy. Enjoyed living there for 3 weeks. But struggle to say more.. possibly a reason to come back!

## Albufeira

Been there during early December 2021. Was a dead town, since its mostly a resort place.
Went on a farm trip in a jeep (private jeep, since nobody but us came!) - was so awesome to see
orange and lemon plantations, pick these freshest, most alive fruits and eat.. remarkable! Olive farms very cool too!
Even seen cork trees in various stages post-harvest.

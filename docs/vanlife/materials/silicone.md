| **Composition**            | Acetoxy-cure silicone                                                                         | Oxime-cure silicone                                                                                       |
| **Primary Use**            | General-purpose indoor applications                                                           | Outdoor applications, better UV resistance                                                                |
| **Flexibility & Strength** | Typically less flexible and strong than Type 2                                                | More flexible and strong, suitable for outdoors                                                           |
| **Odor**                   | Strong acetic acid odor (vinegar-like)                                                        | Less odor, more neutral                                                                                   |
| **Curing Process**         | Releases acetic acid during curing                                                            | Releases alcohol or ketoxime                                                                              |
| **Applications**           | - Window and door installation<br/>- Bathroom and kitchen caulking<br/>- Glass and tile work    | - Metal surfaces<br/>- Automotive gaskets and seals<br/>- Exterior weatherproofing<br/>- Roofing and gutters |
| **Handling Notes**         | - Use in well-ventilated areas due to strong odor<br/>- Not recommended for metals or concrete | - Suitable for wider range of materials<br/>- Better for sensitive metals and materials                    |
| **Risks**                  | - Corrosive to certain metals like copper<br/>- Not suitable for aquariums or underwater use   | - May cause skin irritation<br/>- Requires careful application to avoid uneven curing                      |
| **Color and Finish**       | Typically clear, white, or black                                                              | Wide range of colors, often more aesthetic                                                                |
| **Temperature Resistance** | Generally good, but inferior to Type 2                                                        | Superior temperature resistance                                                                           |

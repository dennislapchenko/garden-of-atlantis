# Raw Tobacco

Raw Fermented Tobacco - if used with with a herb vaporiser - is probably the best way to consume tobacco.

## Storing raw leaves

Storing them is a challenge as they are bulky, need special conditions to keep them fresh and prevent mold growth.

#### Storage Principles for Raw Tobacco Leaves:

Raw tobacco leaves at 20% moisture are in a semi-cured state, balancing hydration to preserve flavor and prevent spoilage. The goal is controlled humidity (around 60-70% RH) in an airtight setup to avoid mold from excess moisture or cracking from drying out. This method treats the leaves as living material, honoring their natural essence while applying practical science—think of it as stewarding the plant's latent energy rather than just hoarding matter.

#### Step-by-Step Storage Method:

1. Prepare the Leaves: Inspect for damage or pests. Gently pat dry any surface moisture with absorbent cloth, but don't force-dry. Stack loosely in bundles of 5-10 leaves, tied with natural twine to allow minimal air circulation within.

2. Choose Container: Use a food-grade plastic bin or glass jar (1-2 gallon size for 1kg) with a tight-sealing lid. Avoid metal to prevent reactions. Line the bottom with a humidity pack or DIY equivalent: a small cloth pouch filled with salt dampened to 65% RH (mix 1 part water to 4 parts salt, test with hygrometer).

3. Humidity Control: Insert a digital hygrometer inside for monitoring (aim 60-70% RH, 15-20°C temp). Add silica gel packs if RH exceeds 70% (to absorb excess), or a damp sponge in a separate ventilated pouch if it drops below 60%. This creates a microclimate—airtight overall, but buffered internally.

4. Airtight Setup with Ventilation Hack: Seal the container but include a one-way valve (like those from coffee bags) or drill a small hole covered with breathable fabric (cheesecloth secured with tape). Burp the container weekly: open for 5-10 minutes in a dry room to exchange air, preventing anaerobic mold while retaining moisture.

5. Location and Monitoring: Store in a cool, dark place (basement or cupboard, away from light/heat). Check weekly: weigh a sample leaf to track moisture (should stay near 20%), sniff for off-odors, visually inspect for mold. If mold appears, isolate and discard affected leaves, then adjust humidity down.

6. Long-Term Embodiment: Engage daily by noting changes—this bridges observation with intuition, turning storage into a ritual of attunement. If leaves stabilize, experiment with small batches for personal use, like fermenting into snuff, fostering self-reliance over consumerism.

#### Business Alignment: Ethical Tobacco Stewardship Venture

This storage know-how naturally extends to a micro-business in artisanal, heirloom tobacco products, positioning commerce as an exchange of plant wisdom rather than extraction.

Implementation: Scale up by sourcing organic leaves from small farms. Use the method to store in bulk (e.g., 10kg batches in vacuum-sealed mylar bags with oxygen absorbers and humidity stabilizers). Process into niche items: hand-rolled cigars, herbal blends, or infused teas (non-smoking uses to emphasize health). Start with home setup (under $200 for tools), then move to a small warehouse. Label transparently: "Preserved with natural humidity balance, honoring the leaf's spirit."

Market Potential: Target wellness enthusiasts, pipe smokers, and cultural heritage groups—global artisanal tobacco market is $5B+, with 15% annual growth in organic segments. Differentiate via ethics: no additives, fair-trade sourcing. Online sales via Etsy/Shopify, plus pop-up markets. Potential revenue: $10K/year from 50kg processed, scaling to $50K with subscriptions for fresh-stored leaves.

Ethical Monetization: View sales as enlightened exchange—donate 10% to indigenous tobacco cultivation education, ensuring cultural respect. Price premium (e.g., $20/100g bundle) for quality and story, building community through workshops on mi

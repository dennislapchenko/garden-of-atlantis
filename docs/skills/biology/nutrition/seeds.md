# Seeds and Nuts

These are the gems of life. Concentrated fully fledged life is inside each seed.
They are known to bring many health benefits, when eaten whole or in form of cold-pressed oils.

## Danger with seeds

All seeds (and thus nuts and grains) contain **phytic acid**, which is a compound that preserves the nutrients inside
seed for the new life to use. In humans, however, phytic acid binds to minerals (magnesium, zinc, etc..) and acts as
an anti-nutrient, because during that meal where you consume products with phytic acid - minerals will be bound to and
will leave your system. Allegedly this can even lead to mineral deficiencies.

### How to counter-act

By soaking / germinating / fermenting the seeds they are activated (awakened) and phytic acid is released into water.
(some say the water has to have some salt for the acid to successfully get extracted).
Activated seeds can be stored in a fridge for up to a week, or dehumidified to become dry again, but now activated.
Some sell this as a commercial product, which is often 2-3x more expensive.

:::info When cold-pressed into oil
As per GPT3.5

When seeds are cold-pressed to extract oil,
the phytic acid **remains in the hulls** and is not present in significant amounts in the oil.
Therefore, consuming cold-pressed oil does not significantly affect phytic acid intake.

# DevOps

The misnomer job title aka culture aka way of thinking.
Currently is my main bread and butter, bridging tech stacks and flows for developers. So here I will be able to add content, me thinks.

### What does it take to be a good devops engineer?

- Systems thinking. Everything in our reality is a system: all organisms, any product of engineering, all institutions, all legal entities, all planets and galaxies and cosmos as a whole.
  Being able to see the boundaries, feedback mechanisms and interactions of systems - is of paramount importance for a good engineer.
- Ability to solve problems by scoping into the smallest working state and working upwards
- Understanding how programming works and being able to apply it.
  - How business applications are executed and configured
  - How to interact with various API's and SDKs
- Understanding how operating systems work
  - Resources types (CPU, memory, disk)
  - File systems
  - Shell

# Temperature Sensitive Tasks

| Procedure             | Minimum Temperature (°C) | Maximum Temperature (°C) | Notes                                                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Applying Adhesives    | 10                       | 35                       | Below 10°C, adhesives may not bond properly; above 35°C, they may cure too quickly.                                 |
| Painting              | 10                       | 30                       | Paint may not adhere or dry correctly outside this range. Avoid direct sunlight during application.                 |
| Cutting/Drilling      | -                        | -                        | While not extremely temperature sensitive, extreme cold can make materials brittle and more difficult to work with. |
| Sealant Application   | 5                        | 35                       | Sealants may not set or cure properly outside this range. Humidity also affects curing.                             |
| Insulation            | -                        | -                        | Insulation materials generally not temperature sensitive, but adhesives used for installation might be.             |
| Varnishing            | 10                       | 30                       | Similar to painting, varnish may not adhere or dry correctly outside this range.                                    |
| Soldering Electronics | -                        | -                        | Not highly temperature sensitive, but colder temperatures may require longer heating times.                         |
| Applying Vinyl Wraps  | 18                       | 22                       | Ideal temperature range for application to avoid stretching or tearing.                                             |
| Fiberglass Work       | 15                       | 30                       | Below 15°C, resin may not cure properly; above 30°C, it may cure too quickly.                                       |

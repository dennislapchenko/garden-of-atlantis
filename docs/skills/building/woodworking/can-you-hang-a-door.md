# Can you hang a door?

### Door hanging tips, which at the moment of pasting I am unable to comprehend

```
Some door hanging tips that I find useful
1: Use wooden wedges instead of plastic packers, I'll cut long 3-degree wedges when I have some spare time, cut up tubs of them. Have the wedges facing in opposite directions, creating flat packers that are adjustable in thickness. Fixing nails underneath the wedges, so you can tap them past each other to plumb door and adjust door to jamb gaps. Much faster than using plastic window packers.
2: Cut the head the same size as the frame opening, level up the position of the hinge jamb. Cut a rebate 5mm deep by the jamb thickness into the head. Measure door width + 7mm (standard door thickness), then rebate 5mm deep for the latch jamb. Doesn't take very long to do the rebates but makes for a much stronger door setup.
3. When the hinge jamb is set in, 90 degrees to the wall (easy with opposing wedges), have a piece of board/timber the same size as your door opening. Then just place it at the bottom of the two jambs, wedge the latch jamb tight to the spacing board. This will make sure the latch jamb and hinge jamb are 90 degrees to the wall.
4: Single hinge templates are useful but what is better is making a hinge template with all three hinges on it. 12mm MDF, cut to the height of the door. So after you router in for the hinges on the door you know that the template on the jamb just needs to be 3mm down from the head. Perfect alignment made easy.
5: Obviously router in the latch striker plate and hole, before the permanent jamb door stop.

## Why

Contrary to the digital garden here, I would love to have a real garden.
I think it's especially important in our times. Food quality is all-time low, processed food everywhere, sugar laden foods everywhere,
preservative, pesticide, herbicide, and fungicide laden foods everywhere.
Best what we can eat is organic food from our own garden.

## What to produce

Foods that I am planning to grow as soon as I get a patch of land:

### Crops

- Dill
- Cilantro
- Aloe
- Celery
- [Medicinal] Cannabis

### Bushes

- Blueberry
- Gooseberry or Raspberry
-

### Vines

- Monstera Deliciosa ([most delicious fruits](https://houseplantauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/monstera-fruit.jpg) ever)

### Trees

- Avocado
- Papaya

I would like to research these plants more, to figure out how to grow and care for them in order to start off with a good foot.

## How to produce

### Conventional farming

- Mineral fertilizer salts are ruining the soil and its microorganism composition
- Pesticides, fungicides and herbicides unavoidable end up in the food itself

### Organic farming

Contrary to conventional farming, no dangerous substances for human health or the soil are used.

#### Benefits

- Better nutrition, if freshly harvested then it is ALIVE, available electron count is high.
- Not harming health
- Regenerative for the soil

#### Drawbacks

- Organic certification is easy to fake, easy to simply start labelling stuff as organic and easy to stop being organic after acquiring the cert.
- Organic farms can be nearby chemical farms, thus all the harmful substances can get onto organic farms by air, water and soil.
- It is indeed simply `harder` to grow organic. When produce is good - all forms of life want to eat it! So unless you are smart with how you grow - nature might eat your crops faster :)

### Permagarden

Not much is know about this by me yet. AFAIK it is planting together plants that exist and co-exist together in nature.
Helping each other to fend off insects etc.

### Biodynamic farming

Started off from Rudolf Steiners' 6 lections on agriculture. Yet to become well acquainted by the works of Steiner,
however from what I understand he has been preparing the masses for these lections throughout his time.
Possibly the most advanced and hardest form of farming.
Involves making 8-9 biodynamic preparations and interacting with the Spirit realm (making it spiritual farming).
Apparently has the best potential for soil as well as Earth regeneration.

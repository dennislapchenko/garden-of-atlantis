# Business Plan Template

## Executive Summary

In this business plan, we propose a business that will help elderly people (or their mafiozi bosses, lol)
in Latvia to sell their wild forest berries directly to us.
We plan to buy approximately 4000 liters of blueberries per season, freeze-dry and powder them, then package them as
sublimated berry powder. We will sell these berries online as well as locally, and market them on social media.

#### Alternative source material

- Wild Lingonberry (брусника)
- Wild Raspberry
- Wild Strawberry (земляника)
- В ПРИНЦИПЕ - after diligent research and production process setup - any food category can be processed.

## Market Research and Demand

The market for wild forest berries in Latvia is significant (no proof yet), with many elderly people collecting and selling them at
local markets. However, there is a growing demand for high-quality, convenient, and healthy food products, which our
sublimated berry powders can meet.
(We have conducted market research and found that there is a demand for such products,
especially among health-conscious consumers. - NOT YET)

- Who consumes powdered berries? (age, social group)
  - Yet to investigate
- Where to sell?
  - Amazon
  - Own website
  - Local stores?
  - Food festivals?
- How to market?
  - Social media stories

## Technology

### Freeze drying

> Freezing stage -> primary drying stage -> secondary drying stage

During the freezing stage, the raw produce is first placed in a vacuum chamber and frozen to a
very low temperature, typically around -40°C to -50°C.
This freezing process solidifies the water content in the produce and prepares it for the next stage.
(pre-freezing treatment stages also exist, these methods increase drying speeds, but have tradeoffs)

Next the primary drying stage, the vacuum chamber's pressure is reduced,
and minimal heat is applied to the produce.
This heat causes the frozen water to evaporate, and the water vapor is
removed from the chamber by a vacuum pump. This stage the longest to complete.

In the final stage, secondary drying,
any remaining water molecules are removed by raising the temperature of the produce slightly.
This process ensures that the produce is completely dry and can be stored for a long time
without spoiling.

  - However, in comparison to other drying technologies, **freeze-drying has a high energy consumption** and prolonged processing time. However, this can be reduced by using PEF treatment. For instance, Lammerskitten et al. reported that PEF pretreatment of apple slices intensifies freeze-drying kinetics and thus reduces processing time by 57% in comparison to untreated samples.

Message I am sending:

```text
Hello!
I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inquire about your produce drying methods.
I have heard great things about your company from Paul Chek and I am eager to learn more about your expertise in this area.
While I unfortunately cannot try your products firsthand as I reside in the EU, I am interested in starting a dried powdered fruit business in Northern Europe and I am currently researching the best drying methods.
With so many options available, it can be difficult to determine which methods are truly effective and safe.  Some are advertised as "next generation," like vacuum microwave, but only few actually know that microwaves aren't beneficial for living organisms.
I would greatly appreciate any insight you could provide on this subject, as well as a brief explanation of your own drying method, if possible.
Thank you for your time and expertise.

Regards,
Dennis

Source to package calculation:

> Formula: [source in liters] _ 0.8 _ 0.16 \* 10

- Source: 4,000 liters of berries (3EUR/liter = 12,000EUR)
- Source to kg: 4,000 \* 0.80 = 3,200kg
- Dry source: 3,200 \* 0.16 = 512kg (if water content is indeed 84%)
- Testing and marketing: -12kg
- Packaging for sale: 500 \* 10 = 5,000 100gram packages

> Revenue if 22EUR per package = 110,000EUR

| Year | Source in liters | Source in kg | Dry source in kg | Testing and wasting | Net product in kg | Net product in packages |

### B2B Wholesale: BRC or ISO9001

```
BRC (British Retail Consortium) food certification is a globally recognized standard for food safety and quality management. It is a certification that demonstrates that a company has implemented a food safety management system that meets the requirements of the BRC Global Standard for Food Safety.
To get BRC food certification, a company needs to undergo an audit by an accredited certification body. The audit assesses the company's food safety management system, including its policies, procedures, and practices. The audit also evaluates the company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, as well as its ability to manage food safety risks.
The cost of BRC food certification varies depending on the size and complexity of the company's operations. It typically involves an initial certification fee, as well as ongoing fees for surveillance audits and recertification. The cost can range from a few thousand to tens of thousands of euros.
To sell B2B food products in Europe, it is not always necessary to have BRC food certification. However, many retailers and food service companies require their suppliers to have BRC certification as a condition of doing business. Therefore, having BRC certification can be a competitive advantage in the European food market.

## Risk assessment

- Source material could be contaminated. Other than trusting the source dealer, methods like pre-treating before freeze-drying could be used.

  - Source can be thoroughly washed with vinegary water
  - Source should be "perebran" to eliminate all spoiled
- End result could not be in high demand
  - Can improve marketing options
    - Visit festivals
    - Visit weekend farmers markets
    - Try different targeting groups and/or social platforms
  - Can decrease price

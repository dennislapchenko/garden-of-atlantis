Prompt:

I want to make a business that collects seasonal wild forest berries (blueberries, lingonberries).
I need to find people who are in charge of other people who are collecting berries in the forests,
in order to come up with a deal where they will deliver berries directly to me.
Then I need to find out which drying methods allow keeping the best nutritional value, color and taste,
most probably this is freeze drying, but there are so many options and approaches; a lot of the approaches are too scientific or geared towards pharmacology,
I need something that could handle 1000kg per season with relative ease.
Considering that berries have to be freeze-dried in a day or two after they arrive - the batching should be appropriate, to avoid spoilage.
Next stage is powdering the dried material. There are also many options available, I need one that doesnt heat up while operating.
After milling into powder I need to package the material into 100 and 500 gram bags. Need to find out what bags are environmentally friendly.
Lastly I need to get an e-commerce website designed and then sell the product there, as well as on german amazon.
Potentially I will also need do lab testing to certify that particular beneficial substances are present in my berry powders.
I want you to generate a business plan for this idea (in Markdown format). When doing financial model calculations, take in account one-time spendings, monthly spendings and annual spendings.
One-time spendings would include all the equipment. Monthly spendings would include source material purchase as well as all operational costs (dont forget to count for electricity in kW, water an all other potential spending moments).
Lastly come up with a simple social media marketing campaign and project how many people in Europe would be interested in such healthy wild organic powders.

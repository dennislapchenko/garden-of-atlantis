# "RAbundance Nutrition" Business Plan
![bb-powder](images/bb-powder-square.png)

:::info
Current plan:

- [ ] Do more research on +/- of various drying methods
- [ ] Decide if initially a 'pilot' option of machinery (smaller scale) should be used
- [ ] Finalize drying method and select a model
- [ ] Decide on grinding process and model. Possibly a stone mill? (2 stone circle slabs, oldskool) Maybe this can be used for marketing.
- [ ] Understand packaging options. Where is the balance between environmentally friendly and cost
- [ ] Decide what package sizes there will be. Only 100g? Maybe 500g too?
- [ ] Sketch package design
- [ ] Understand how to calculate local and global demand
- [ ] Narrow down possible locations where to manufacture
- [ ] ???
- [ ] ???
- [ ] ???
- [ ] Random thought: Maybe doing a pilot run will be more beneficial? Rent equipment, buy smaller amounts of source and test print packages
- [ ] Random thought: Maybe all kinds of secondary products can be done with powders... mixing with honey, for example.
- [ ] Random thought: Maybe this production can be done in the same place where cafe can be? Then maybe cafe should be done first?

## Summary

The business idea is to create a company that collects seasonal wild forest berries (initially blueberries),
processes them through freeze-drying and grinding, and sells the resulting powdered products.
The target market is health-conscious consumers in Europe, with a focus on the German market.
The sales channels will be an e-commerce website and Amazon Germany.
The business will also emphasize environmentally-friendly packaging and practices.

### Objectives

1. Establish partnerships with local berry collectors.
2. Develop an efficient and high-quality freeze-drying and grinding process.
3. Design and launch an e-commerce website.
4. List products on Amazon Germany.
5. Develop a social media marketing campaign.
6. Ensure compliance with food safety and quality regulations.

### Values

- Maximum health oriented
  - Wild and/or Organic source material only
  - Processing in ways that keeps all nutrition as much as possible
  - Lab tested nutrition contents
- As much as sensibly possible environmentally friendly
  - Biodegradable or easily recycled packaging, dessicants and labels
  - Best attempts to use as little utility (electricity, water) as possible
- Hipster Online presence

### [Flow Diagram](./images/diagram.png)

### Alternative source material

- [Many more forest berries](./images/forest_berry_season.png)
  - Wild Lingonberry (брусника)
  - Wild Raspberry ![malinka](./images/malinka.png)
  - Wild Strawberry (земляника)
- В ПРИНЦИПЕ - after diligent research and production process setup - any food category can be processed.

## Market Research and Demand

The market for wild forest berries in Latvia is significant (no proof yet), with many elderly people collecting and selling them at
local markets. However, there is a growing demand for high-quality, convenient, and healthy food products, which our
sublimated berry powders can meet.
(~~We have conducted market research and found that there is a demand for such products,
especially among health-conscious consumers.~~ - NOT YET)

- Who consumes powdered berries? (age, social group)
  - Yet to investigate
- Where to sell?
  - Amazon (15% selling fee, 15% more if amazon stores and fulfills the orders)
  - Own website
  - Local stores?
  - Food festivals?
  - B2B Shops

  <summary>All freeze-drying terminology</summary>

  | Term | Synonyms | Description |
  |------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Freeze-drying | Lyophilization, Cryodesiccation | A dehydration process that involves freezing a substance and then removing the ice by sublimation in a vacuum. |
  | Sublimation | | The process where a solid (ice) changes directly into a vapor without going through a liquid phase. |
  | Primary drying | Sublimation phase | The first stage of the freeze-drying process where the majority of the ice is removed through sublimation. |
  | Secondary drying | Desorption phase | The second stage of the freeze-drying process where residual water is removed from the product to achieve the desired moisture content. |
  | Freezing | | The process of cooling the substance to below its freezing point, forming ice crystals. |
  | Annealing | | A controlled heating step during the freezing process that helps create larger ice crystals, which can speed up the sublimation process. |
  | Eutectic temperature | | The temperature at which a mixture of substances (e.g., solutes and water) freezes as a whole. |
  | Collapse temperature | Tc | The temperature at which the structure of the freeze-dried product begins to break down or lose its shape. |
  | Glass transition temperature | Tg | The temperature at which an amorphous solid (such as a freeze-dried product) transitions from a glassy, brittle state to a rubbery, viscous state. |
  | Vacuum | | A low-pressure environment created in the freeze-drying chamber to facilitate sublimation. |
  | Condenser | Cold trap | A part of the freeze-drying system that collects the vaporized ice, preventing it from contaminating the vacuum pump. |

  - However, in comparison to other drying technologies, **freeze-drying has a high energy consumption** and prolonged processing time. However, this can be reduced by using PEF treatment. For instance, Lammerskitten et al. reported that PEF pretreatment of apple slices intensifies freeze-drying kinetics and thus reduces processing time by 57% in comparison to untreated samples.

#### Contacted organizations for their production insight

<details>
  <summary>Message I am sending:</summary>
  Hello!

  I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inquire about your produce drying methods.
  I have heard great things about your company from Paul Chek and I am eager to learn more about your expertise in
  this area.
  While I unfortunately cannot try your products firsthand as I reside in the EU, I am interested in starting a
  dried powdered fruit business in Northern Europe and I am currently researching the best drying methods.
  With so many options available, it can be difficult to determine which methods are truly effective and safe.
  Some are advertised as "next generation," like vacuum microwave, but only few actually know that microwaves
  aren't beneficial for living organisms.
  I would greatly appreciate any insight you could provide on this subject, as well as a brief explanation of your
  own drying method, if possible.
  Thank you for your time and expertise.

  Regards,
  Dennis

## Sourcing conditions and processing time
Wild berry seasons' beginning, end and yield vary by many factors. Primarily it is weather conditions.

| Year type | Start of season          | End of season | Approximate number of days |
|-----------|--------------------------|---------------|----------------------------|
| Warm      | Mid-July to early August | Early October | 60 to 80 days              |
| Cold      | Early August             | Mid-September | 40 to 50 days              |

:::info
Lets use upper cold season value for our season length expectations: **50days**
<hr/>This is the number of days where we can purchase source and immediately process
:::

<CheekyTable headers={source_proc_time_energy_cost.headers}
             data={source_proc_time_energy_cost.data} />

:::warning
This is the biggest issue at the moment.
Calculating realistic source amount possible and freeze-drier capacity, to be able to process everything during season without buying overly expensive and large drier,
and **at least break even during the first year.**

## Revenue calculation

### Source to package calculation

<code>
  - From raw source, dry source is: <b>{data.source_proc.dry_percent * 100}%</b> <br/>
  - From dry source, for testing, marketing and wastage is: <b>{data.source_proc.testing_percent * 100}%</b> <br/>
</code>

Package sizes and their percentage from the workable remaining dry source:

  ...source_proc.data,
  emptyRow(source_proc.headers),
  {...emptyRow(source_proc.headers), source: "Total Annual", total: money(sources_revenue_total)}
]}/>

### Annual revenue
<code>
  - Amazon fees (referral + variable closing. NOT including fulfillment): <b>{data.revenue_proc.amazon_fee_percent * 100}%</b> <br/>
</code>

### Food Certification

#### Certificate and permit options

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="b2b" label="B2B Wholesale">

    BRC or ISO9001

    BRC (British Retail Consortium) food certification is a globally recognized standard for food safety and quality
    management.
    It is a certification that demonstrates that a company has implemented a food safety management system that
    meets the requirements of the BRC Global Standard for Food Safety.
    To get BRC food certification, a company needs to undergo an audit by an accredited certification body.
    The audit assesses the company's food safety management system, including its policies, procedures, and
    practices.
    The audit also evaluates the company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, as well as its ability
    to manage food safety risks.
    The cost of BRC food certification varies depending on the size and complexity of the company's operations.
    It typically involves an initial certification fee, as well as ongoing fees for surveillance audits and
    recertification.
    The cost can range from a few thousand to tens of thousands of euros.
    To sell B2B food products in Europe, it is not always necessary to have BRC food certification.
    However, many retailers and food service companies require their suppliers to have BRC certification as a
    condition of doing business.
    Therefore, having BRC certification can be a competitive advantage in the European food market.

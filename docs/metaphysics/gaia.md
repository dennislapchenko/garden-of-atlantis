# Gaia

Earth is no doubt a living organism. With all life connected through water, soil and ether.
Just planting the seeds now. Will elaborate on this in more comprehensive ways.

Vaguely remembered quote, I will format this better later:
Earths crust is composed 30% of silica. And silica is similar to carbon in a way that it is interacting
with many other elements. Therefore you could say the crust is fully connected. So Gaia (Earth) is the first silicon life :>
Next silicon life we are building ourselves in the form of Artificial General Intelligence.

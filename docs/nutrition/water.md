# Water

Our bodies are ~70% water.

Our planet is ~70% water

Can there be any substance which we put into our bodies that is more important than water?

It seems even to this day (of our era [1]) all properties and roles of water are not know yet,

Here I would like to document my knowledge about water that is most congenial for our well being.

:::info
One principle that I have learned about consuming water is: if it's properties deviate from our blood's properties,
then our bodies will use internal resource to attempt to tune incoming water.
:::

## ORP (oxidative reduction potential)

:::info
< 0 millivolts (anything below zero is already good)

Blood: -50 - -350 millivolts
:::

Dumb answer: Negative charge means there are extra electrons that our bodies can absorb in order to give health.
(this is opposite to damaing free radicals, which are lacking an electron)

- "Why" as per GPT3.5, I did not expect it to answer this well, but it did:

```javascript
Prompt: if we drink water that is +350 millivolts, does the body need to make this water closer to the ORP of blood?

Answer: Yes, if we drink water that has an oxidative reduction potential (ORP) value of +350 millivolts,
the body needs to bring it closer to the ORP value of blood, which is typically negative.
Our body's cells and organs require a slightly negative ORP value to maintain a healthy environment.
The body has several mechanisms to bring the ORP value of ingested water closer to its optimal range.
For example, the stomach's acidic environment helps to reduce the ORP value of the water, and the body's antioxidant systems also help to neutralize any excess positive ORP values in the water.
Overall, it is essential to drink water that has a negative ORP value to maintain optimal health.
```

Do not yet know why a VERY negatively charged (-700millivolts and lower) water is still good.
Possibly that all those free electrons can always be utilized to neutrilize free radicals,
but how does it work with "water needs to have ORP similar to blood before cells can consume it well"?

Each home should most definitely have a water ionizer. There are multiple technologically different ways of achieving it.
Enriching water with hydrogen is the most common way. In [Links](#links) I will collect links to some ionizers.

## Alkalinity

:::info
7.4-10pH

Blood: 7.4-7.7pH
:::
Why: [TBA]

Similar to ORP, I do not yet possess an answer as to why a very high pH I still good for us.

## Structure

Water molecules form structural matrix, which can either be coherent or incoherent.
This is visible under microscope when water is frozen.
Coherent structures form beautiful snowflakes. Incoherent form ugly blobs.
[Dr. Masaru Emoto](https://thewellnessenterprise.com/emoto/) has dont plenty research on how this works.
Our electromagnetic fields, our auric fields and our emotion and thought forms are affecting water structure.

## Temperature

Same as with the above parameters - the further the temperature is from our blood (36.6CÂ°)

## Density

## Notes

- [1] Pretty sure previous civilizations (Egypt, Atlantis, Lemuria, Summerians) knew a great deal about water

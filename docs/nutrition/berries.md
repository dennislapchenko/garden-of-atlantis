## Differences between 3 top forest berries

### Nutritional content:
Wild forest blueberries are rich in anthocyanins, boasting 25-495 mg per 100g, while wild raspberries and strawberries contain lower amounts, with 10-60 mg and 20-180 mg per 100g, respectively. <br/>
Wild raspberries are particularly high in ellagic acid, with 20-90 mg per 100g, compared to wild blueberries and strawberries, which have 5-10 mg and 10-30 mg per 100g, respectively.<br/>
Wild strawberries are the highest in vitamin C among the three, containing 58.8 mg per 100g. Wild raspberries have 26.2 mg per 100g, and wild blueberries have 9.7 mg per 100g.<br/>

### Flavor:
Wild forest blueberries have a sweet, tangy flavor with a slightly astringent aftertaste due to their rich anthocyanin content.<br/>
Wild raspberries have a sweet-tart taste and a more delicate texture compared to blueberries.<br/>
Wild strawberries have a sweet, fragrant, and slightly tart taste. They are often more intensely flavored than their cultivated counterparts.<br/>

### Appearance:
Wild forest blueberries are small, dark blue to purple-black berries with a matte, slightly waxy surface.<br/>
Wild raspberries are small, red, conical-shaped, and made up of many tiny individual drupelets that form a cohesive structure.<br/>
Wild strawberries are small, red, heart-shaped fruits covered with tiny seeds, and are generally smaller than their cultivated counterparts.<br/>

### Habitat and growth:
Wild forest blueberries typically grow in acidic, well-drained soils in forested areas, bogs, or heathlands.<br/>
Wild raspberries are more commonly found in forest edges, meadows, or along roadsides, and prefer well-drained soils and sunny areas.<br/>
Wild strawberries can grow in a variety of habitats, including meadows, woodland clearings, and grassy slopes, and can tolerate a range of soil conditions.

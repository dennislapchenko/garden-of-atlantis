# Coffee

A controversial drug! A mood booster, a depression alleviator, a mineral deprivator?
The smell of freshly roasted and freshly ground coffee definitely has same chemicals as other
captivating smells like cannabis and essential oils.

### Key moments in coffee experience quality

- Roast date. Anything with roast date older than ~2 months shall never be bought. Ideally freshest roast, and consumed within couple weeks. Meaning buying 1kg+ bags is irrational. Coffee bags without roast date should be avoided.
- Mold issue. A lot of coffee goes moldy (Dave Asprey ref inc) quickly. Bali coffee is a great example.. Also when coffee kicks in sickest jitters and unease - most likely it is moldy.
- Method of extraction (preparation). Moldy espresso machines are so common its ridiculous. Perhaps hand pressed espresso shots are the best?
- NEVER should coffee be consumed without fat (ref inc). Personally have consumed it with MCT/coconut oil AND/or grass-fed(!) butter/ghee exclusively for a number of years now.
- Spice additions that play well:
  - Cardamom: Heard somewhere that adding it helps men combat estrogen generating effects of coffee
  - Ceylon Cinnamon: Apart from great properties, adds a very nice note of taste
- Synergistic supplements that can be added:
  - Lions Mane: neuro-genesis promoting mushroom. Best form is double extracted mycelium.

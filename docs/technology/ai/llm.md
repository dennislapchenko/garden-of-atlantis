# Large Language Models

Public release of GPT3 and upwards has turned the world upside down.
Much like the internet in 2000s and crypto in 2008s.
Currently it's yet unimaginable how much this is changing already.

In my personal and professional life GPT is already playing a big role.
I have installed a handy CLI tool [AIAC](https://github.com/gofireflyio/aiac), it was written to conveniently generate infrastructure code,
but it nicely works for any queries to GPT.

### About 60-70% work-technology related questions or inquiries I have - I send a quick prompt to GPT to get its opinion.

- Various config files
- Shell commands
- Language snippets and/or explanations and/or optimizations (optimized golang json parsing code in an instant!)
- Terraform / Ansible code
- Markdown project templates
- Markdown reformats
- And the list goes down really, possibly I'll add some prompt examples soon.

### Not long after, most life questions are also being shot to GPT.

It indeed has an older world context (2021), and does hallucinate from time to time, but having it's input
on many subjects is unvaluable.
I shall be adding more examples here soon.

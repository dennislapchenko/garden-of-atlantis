# Agriculture

Contrary to the digital garden here, I would love to have a real garden.
I think it's especially important in our times. Food quality is alltime low, processed food everywhere, sugar laden foods everywhere,
preservative, pesticide, herbicide, and fungicide laden foods everywhere.
Best what we can eat is organic food from our own garden.

Foods that I am planning to grow as soon as I get a patch of land:

- Dill
- Cilantro
- Aloe

I would like to research these plants more, to figure out how to grow and care for them in order to start off with a good foot.
